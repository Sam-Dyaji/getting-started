# Write a program that is capable of handling simple restaurants!
# These restaurants have only one product: menu. Different restaurants can have different prices for their menus.
# Weâ€™d like to create a new restaurant in the program by giving the name of the restaurant and the price of the menu there.
# The restaurants give a discount to their employees, they get a menu for half price, while a guest needs to pay the full price.
# The restaurants can sit customers at tables (without limitations) and can serve menus to all the current customers. 
# Whenever a menu is served, the customer pays, which is added to the income of the restaurant, 
# and the customer also stands up from the table.
# Using your solution, the following code should run without errors and print the expected results.
